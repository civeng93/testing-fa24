The lognormal distribution is used for modeling various natural phenomena such as income, amount of rainfall, length of chess games, stock prices, and many others. Due to its mathematical nature, the lognormal distribution can be confusing. So, we'll try to break it down to understand its properties, parameters, and its relation to the normal distribution. \n",
